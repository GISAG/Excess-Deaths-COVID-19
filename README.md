# Excess-Deaths-COVID-19
Monitoring the spread of the emerging Covid-19 pandemic has taken the world by storm. From the initial reports of a novel virus spreading in Wuhan, China, to the Fall of 2020, people around the world have turned to geographic information systems (GIS) and online maps to track its spread. 
To control the pandemic, scientists have begun to analyze and model the spread of cases to evaluate factors which may influence the rate of growth and predict future spread. Unfortunately, many early Covid-19 cases went undetected due to lack of testing and disparities in access. Additionally, testing rates and efficacy are not consistent across geographies and time. 
For many reasons, current records of Covid-19 cases represent a biased and considerable under count, negatively impacting predictions and estimates moving forward. We estimate excess deaths using the The CDC National Center for Health Statistics and Provisional Mortality Data and the Provisional COVID-19 Death Counts by Week Ending Data and State to find estimates of excess deaths at a county level.
